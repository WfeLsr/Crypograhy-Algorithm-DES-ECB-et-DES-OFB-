In this repository we have:

Algorithm de cryptography : Block ciphers
Using ECB-DES:
/* This application enables you to encrypt and decode a block using the ECB cryptographic mode DES method.*/
/* First, enter the key after dividing the message into blocks of 8; if the block numbers (bn) are less than 8, padding is added;
 if they are greater than 8, the reverse is true(for decryption). English comments between braket*/

Using OFB-DES:
/* This program allows each key to be ENCRYPTED using the OFB cryptographic mode DES algorithm*/
/* This program allows you to DECIPHER a block using the OFB cryptographic mode DES algorithm*/
